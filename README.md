## Personalized Federated Learning over Resource Constrained Devices in a Split Learning Setting

### Abstract

Advances in wireless connectivity have tremendously facilitated the accretive incorporation of IoT devices (i.e sensors, 'smart' gadgets, etc) in our daily lives, as a result, an unprecedented volume of decentralized and statistically heterogeneous data has been brought into existence. Simultaneously, an increasing number of people familiarize themselves with artificial intelligence through daily interactions, thus recognising its potential as a powerful tool that can facilitate their everyday lives. Therefore, a need to leverage this data ubiquity for machine learning is created, in conjunction with a need for frameworks that can be deployed in such resource constrained environments and ensure, to a degree, users' data privacy. This study focuses on the evaluation of a novel framework, SplitGP (\cite{han2023splitgp}), aiming to concurrently capture both device-specific personalization and network-wide generalization, by treating the client and server side models as one multi-exit neural network, adopting a Federated and Split Learning hybrid approach. We extensively analyze the framework's performance with respect to different hyper-parameter values, attempting to reproduce and validate the authors' results and identify potential room for improvement.
